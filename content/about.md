I’m a software engineer deeply invested in the open-source scientific ecosystem.
I love working with the OS communities and have been taking care of the
[Zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/) ecosystem since 2022.  I wear
multiple hats in the open-source software world — writing code, creating
processes and workflows, steering various committees, organising technical
meet-ups and global conferences, and many more.

When I’m not working, you can find me trekking in the Himalayas. Mountains are
my second favourite thing, right after computers. I also play video games, watch
movies, play football and run marathons.
